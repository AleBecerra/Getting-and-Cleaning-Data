Getting and Cleaning Data. Course project



This repository contains the R code for the course project of the Coursera MOOC Getting-and-Cleaning-Data. It downloads a Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set from the web (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) and after some processing returns a tidy table with the main variables.

For details about variables check CodeBook.md

Brief description of the code

1 - Cleaning the workspace
2 - Downloading the dataset from the web and unzipping in a created directory
3 - Reading the downloaded tables y combining them in new tables (deleting old tables that won't be used anymore)
4 - Reading variable names y activity labels from downloaded txt file
5 - Creating a big data set with all the data and naming the columns
6 - Selecting the desired variables and creating a new dataset only with the selected variables
7 - Changing variable names for more suitable names
8 - Calculating the mean of each subset of the data
9 - Writing a txt file with the tidy data
10 - Cleaning the workspace, only keeping the tidy table
